        <p>The Pre-Collegiate Program of Yangon (PCP) is currently accepting course proposals from qualified instructors in the following areas: World History, Sciences, Economics, and Political Science. <br/><br/>

Extraordinary candidates who hold Bachelor’s degrees will be considered, though ideal candidates possess Master’s degrees and at least two years of international teaching experience at the pre-collegiate or university level. In addition to teaching core academic subjects, instructors at PCP guide students through an intensive college admissions season; therefore, familiarity with international college and university admissions processes and standards is advantageous.</p>
