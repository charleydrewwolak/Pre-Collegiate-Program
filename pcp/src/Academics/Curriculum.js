            <p ><em>During the three academic terms, students take courses, listed below.</em></p>
            <p ><strong>Interpreting and Composing Texts:</strong> This course develops critical reading and writing skills and enhances understanding of the richness of contemporary global diversity through a study of popular and literary texts. Through reading and discussing these texts, we practice our English language skills at the same time that we increase the depth of our global cultural awareness and cultivate deeper appreciation of other cultures.  We spend time engaged in dialogue, both in discussion and written reflections, about the texts and the cultures that produced them.  Students produce three major essays:  a personal essay, a rhetorical analysis, and a researched argumentative essay. Additionally, we devote some time to the study of writing and grammar as a way of learning more about language, improving fluency, and enhancing skills necessary to be successful on standardized tests such as the IELTS and SAT.</p>
            <p ><strong>World Philosophies:</strong> This course approaches philosophy not as a historical phenomenon invented by the Greeks, as is commonly assumed, but as a global, human endeavor practiced all over the world, in different ways at different times. We examine what major world philosophies have to say about the interrelationships between ideas, perceptions, and actions. Moreover, rather than focus on philosophy as a discipline unto itself, this course emphasizes how philosophical ideas and methods of thinking overlap with and bear on various academic, social, and personal spheres.</p>
            <p ><strong>Introduction to Anthropology:</strong> This course is an introduction to anthropology and ways of understanding the diversity of human cultural practices. Designed to teach students to “think like an anthropologist,” the first term covers basic anthropological research methods and surveys some of the central ideas and developments in the field over the last century with a particular emphasis on recent attention to globalization. The second term examines contemporary issues of global mobility and migration. By focusing on the political, economic, and social influences on migration flows, and with the help of readings that focus in on particular problems and/or regions of the world, students learn to analyze the causes, consequences, and experiences of modern movement. The goal of this second term is to enable students to contribute thoughtfully to discussions about the primary economic, humanitarian, and sociopolitical forces that are driving, sustaining, and governing the phenomenon of contemporary global migration. Finally, students turn to the anthropology of history.</p>
            <p ><strong>Introduction to Gender Studies:</strong> This course is an introduction to women, gender and sexuality studies.  We take an interdisciplinary and transnational approach to understanding how sex, gender, and sexuality have been socially constructed at various times in history and in various places around the world. We examine a range of materials—from academic articles to documentaries to speeches and interviews—and unpacking them together.  Throughout this process, we interrogate how sexed bodies, gender identities and sexual desires are discussed and debated in popular culture and within different academic disciplines, in order to understand how gender and sexuality shape and are shaped by other categories, such as race, ethnicity, class, and ability.  Throughout this process, we consider how feminist and queer scholars and activists use their work to critique and dismantle dominant power structures to envision lasting forms of social change.</p>
            <p ><strong>Science and Society:</strong> Far from the focus on mastering pre-packaged content often found in high school curricula, this course reintroduces students to the field of science by taking a high plane view on the scientific enterprise. Students are encouraged to become familiar and engage critically with scientific methods and tools, before diving into materials science, big data, and the history of science. These multidisciplinary fields allow for an exploration of our surroundings that touches on elements of physics, chemistry, biology and may open up reflections about the complexities of ‘doing science.’</p>
            <p ><em>Additionally, students spend significant time on each of the&nbsp;following activities.</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li ><strong>Field Trips</strong> – Students explore Yangon and Myanmar, develop observational and analytical skills, and write field reports on our bi-weekly field trips. Trips include&nbsp;visiting a garment factory, examining ancient and modern Twante kilns, and exploring exploring mangrove forests. Additionally, we take two week-long&nbsp;trips, to study Burmese history, arhitecture, and archaeology at Bagan, and to study economics, political science, and culture in rural Shan State.</li>
              <br/>
              <li ><strong>Touchstones Discussions</strong> – Touchstones uses small group and class discussion to explore issues raised by texts from many societies. Learn more about how students find their voices, develop cooperative learning, and augment their critical thinking at <a href="http://www.touchstones.org">touchstones.org</a>.</li>
              <br/>
              <li ><strong>Newsroom</strong> – This course, which meets once per week, is a discussion-based class that gives students the opportunity to discuss current events in Myanmar and beyond. Students learn about how these situations have come to be, similar cases that have happened before, and what might be done to change them in the future.</li>
              <br/>
              <li ><strong>SAT Preparation</strong> – Students learn knowledge and skills necessary to succeed on the SAT exam and <a href="./financial-aid">earn admission and scholarships</a> to foreign universities.</li>
              <br/>
              <li ><strong>Community Service</strong> – From four to eight hours each week, students learn outside of the classroom, build connections, and create positive change in their communities. Students can volunteer at the Myanmar Education Center for the Blind, teach at local monasteries, and translate Khan Academy videos into Burmese, among other activities.</li>
              <br/>
              <li ><strong>Internships</strong> – Our students gain experience and make connections in Myanmar’s professional world during a four-month <a href="./intern">internship</a>. Projects vary based on the individual’s interest and include working at the Myanmar Times, assisting research at MMRD (Myanmar Marketing Research &amp; Development), surveying workers with the International Labor Organization, and learning documentary filmmaking with Tagu Films.</li>
