            <p ><em>During the three academic terms, students take courses, listed below.</em></p>
            <p ><strong>World Philosophies</strong> – The course explores profound ideas through a variety of lenses. The first term consists of a thorough investigation of Buddhist philosophy and other Eastern ideas before shifting West in the second and third terms to explore Classical Greek, Roman, and modern philosophies. This course gives students the tools to reflect critically on their own lives and the world around them, using some of the greatest thinkers from throughout history as guides. By doing so, students will become strong independent thinkers, sharpen their skills in analysis, discussion, and writing, and become active participants in important conversations for the rest of their lives.</p>
            <p ><strong>Integrated Science</strong> – This course explores such various scientific topics as evolution, the origin of life, polymer science, and global warming in terms of both their fundamental scientific mechanisms and the significant roles that they play in contemporary society. In addition, the course provides students with opportunities to “speak science” by letting them discuss their own opinion of these subjects in class and by having them present research from a scientist of their choice.</p>
            <p ><strong>Comparative Literature</strong> – The three pervading subjects of this class are ‘self,’ ‘community,’ and ‘globalization.’ We look at texts from across the globe. These tell about the creation of the world and the emotions of a minute, the convictions of societies and the insecurities of individuals. Students will learn and reflect upon the great diversity of life and human experience.</p>
          
            <p ><strong>American History</strong> – This course examines topics from the earliest settlement of America to the present day.&nbsp; Particular attention is given to marginalized and oppressed groups as well as to the development of representative institutions.&nbsp; Students learn from a variety of sources: lectures, group discussions, textbooks, articles, essays, primary documents, maps, and animations.</p>
            <p ><em>Additionally, students spend significant time on each of the&nbsp;following activities.</em></p>
            <ul>
            <li ><strong>Field Trips</strong> – Students explore Yangon and Myanmar, develop observational and analytical skills, and write field reports on our bi-weekly field trips. Trips include&nbsp;visiting a garment factory, examining ancient and modern Twante kilns, and exploring exploring mangrove forests. Additionally, we take two week-long&nbsp;trips, to study Burmese history, arhitecture, and archaeology at Bagan, and to study economics, political science, and culture in rural Shan State.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
            <li ><strong>Touchstones Discussions</strong> – Touchstones uses small group and class discussion to explore issues raised by texts from many societies. Learn more about how students find their voices, develop cooperative learning, and augment their critical thinking at <a href="http://www.touchstones.org">touchstones.org</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li ><strong>Newsroom </strong>– This course, which meets once per week, is a discussion-based class that gives students the opportunity to discuss current events in Myanmar and beyond. Students learn about how these situations have come to be, similar cases that have happened before, and what might be done to change them in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li ><strong>SAT Preparation</strong> – Students learn knowledge and skills necessary to succeed on the SAT exam and <a href="./financial-aid">earn admission and scholarships</a> to foreign universities.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li ><strong>Community Service</strong> – For half a day each week, students have the opportunity to learn outside of the classroom, build connections, and create positive change in their community. Students can volunteer&nbsp;at the Myanmar Education Center for the Blind, teach at local monasteries, and translate Khan Academy videos into Burmese.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li ><strong>Internships</strong> – Our students gain experience and make connections in Myanmar’s professional world during a four-month <a href="./intern">internship</a>. Projects vary based on the individual’s interest and include working at the Myanmar Times, assisting research at MMRD (Myanmar Marketing Research &amp; Development), surveying workers with the International Labor Organization, and learning documentary filmmaking with Tagu Films.</li>
