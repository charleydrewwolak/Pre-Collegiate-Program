        <p><strong><em>Who are PCPians?</em></strong></p>
        <p>PCP students come from many different walks of life around Myanmar. Many students come from Yangon, but others come from Mandalay, Lashio, Meiktila, Hpa-An, Falam, Mogok, and Tedim. Their parents come from a great variety of occupations, from architects and doctors to farmers and shopkeepers. Some students join us after a year of study in medical school, while others come directly after finishing class ten in international schools or government schools. For all of their diversity, there are certain qualities which unite all PCPians. They are inquisitive, creative, and open in their thinking, and they are always seeking to improve their understanding and their communities. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><em>Life at PCP</em></strong></p>
        <p>Learning is a way of life for PCPians.  In addition to participating regularly in course-related reading, writing, and discussion, students can expect to frequently remain at school in the evenings, even after classes have ended, whether to work on assignments as a team, connect with instructors during their office hours, or simply enjoy being in the company of like-minded individuals.</p>
        <p>Our frequent excursions and commitment to community service mean that PCPians can often be seen around the Yangon area, checking out a new exhibit at the zoo or museum, interviewing citizens for Rangoon Revealed, volunteering at Mary Chapman School for the Deaf, or working to increase visibility for LBGT+ citizens in Myanmar, among many other activities.</p>
        <p>On Saturday mornings, we welcome the public and prospective students to join us for Presentation-Discussion, where PCPians will present their latest obsessions and pose questions to the audience that prompt lively exchanges.  On Saturday afternoons, you’ll find PCP instructor Dr. Joe McClellan hosting the Sutta Studies group, bringing new perspectives to ancient texts and exploring with young people the continuing relevance of Buddhism in their lives.</p>
        <p>PCPians have together developed and performed plays, celebrated one another’s cultural and religious holidays, sung together on long bus rides, trekked through mountains, swum in the ocean, and shared innumerable breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks! We are a unique and extraordinary community of life-long learners and we welcome you to join us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><em>Committing to Your Future </em></strong></p>
        <p>PCP is a rigorous 16-month course that gives students the academic, critical thinking, and social skills to become leaders and change makers for Myanmar’s future. We divide our academic year into four terms, the first three of which are spent at our downtown campus. During this time, which lasts from February through December, students take classes in variety of areas, attend field trips, and develop the academic and interpersonal skills necessary for success. We also work with students to create a personalized plan to apply for admission and scholarships to study at a foreign university.</p>
        <p>We have class each week Monday through Thursday, starting at 9:30 am sharp and usually finishing in the late afternoon or early evening. On Fridays, students perform their community service.  Occasionally, our field trip activities cause a slight change in the schedule. We do observe Myanmar’s official public holidays.
Our fourth term runs from February to June, and is somewhat more flexible. During this time, we take a week-long field trip to rural Myanmar, and students intern at a variety of organizations around the country. All students are expected to work full time, though the exact schedule will vary based on the organization’s specific needs.</p>
        <p>We believe that each course and extracurricular experience contribute to shaping the future for our students and their communities. At PCP, students have access to highly dedicated and qualified teachers who work assiduously to help each student succeed. PCP is a full-time course of study and most of our students report that they have never before worked as hard as they do while enrolled in the program.  Because the breadth and rigor of PCP’s academic and co-curricula are so demanding, we do not permit our students to attend outside tuitions while they are enrolled.</p>
